Description
-----------

The MAX31760 integrates temperature sensing along with precision PWM fan
control. Please read the datasheet referenced above for a comprehensive
description of this device.

This device driver's hwmon integration provides the common sysfs interfaces to
manage two fans and two temperature sensors, and pwm controls for the fan speed.
A temperature to pwm lookup table is exposed via a series of 'auto_point'
configuration files. See Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface for more
information.

The following custom controls are defined (in the custom sub-directory):

config_load	- Load from the EEPROM into registers.
config_store	- Store register contents into the EEPROM.
		  Write "0" to these to read or write the entire register
		  contents. Write a bit-field as per the datasheet to write a
		  portion of the register contents.

pwm1_fallback	- PWM value in the range of 0 to 255 to be used when a fan is
		  faulty.

pwm1_ramp_rate	- PWM increment per second when the PWM value is changed.
		  Accepted values are 8, 16, 32, or 255 (instantaneous).
