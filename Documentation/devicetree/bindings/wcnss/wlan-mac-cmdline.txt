* WLAN MAC address helper driver

This driver retrieves the WLAN MAC address(es) from the kernel
command-line when the system starts.

The driver looks for a DT node called 'board-info', and expects the
following properties within:

- goog,wlan-mac-0-cmdline-arg:
    The key string specifing the command-line argument for the first
    WLAN MAC address.

Optional properties:
- goog,wlan-mac-1-cmdline-arg:
    The key string specifing the command-line argument for the second
    WLAN MAC address.

Example:

/ {
	board-info {
		goog,wlan-mac-0-cmdline-arg = "wifimac0";
		goog,wlan-mac-1-cmdline-arg = "wifimac1";
	};
};
