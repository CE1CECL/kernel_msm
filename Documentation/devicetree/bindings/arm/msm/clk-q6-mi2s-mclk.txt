Hexagon AFE MI2S MCLK Driver

This driver provides a standard clock driver interface for use in I2S devices
that are connected to the MSM LPASS.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,q6-mi2s-mclk".
- #clock-cells:		Must be <1>.

Example:
	&soc {
		mi2s_mclk: mi2s_mclk {
			compatible = "qcom,q6-mi2s-mclk";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
		};
	};

I2S devices refer to the clock as follows:

	headset: name {
		...
		clocks = <&mi2s_mclk clk_sec_mi2s_mclk>;
		clock-names = "mclk";
		...
	};

Where 'clk_sec_mi2s_mclk' specifies the MCLK for the secondary I2S bus.
See include/dt-bindings/clock/audio-ext-clk.h for a list of supported
I2S interfaces.
