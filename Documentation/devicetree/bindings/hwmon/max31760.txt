MAX31760 fan controller
-----------------------

This device supports I2C only. Fan sub-nodes must be defined in order to enable
the fan tachometer input. See also the datasheet:
https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX31760.pdf

Required node properties:
 - compatible: "maxim,max31760"
 - reg: The I2C address of the device. This is 0x50 - 0x57 depending on the
   hardware configuration.
 - #address-cells: Must be 1.
 - #size-cells: Must be 0.

Optional node properties:
 - maxim,fan-fail-full-only: Boolean; Fan failure can be asserted if and only if
   the PWM is set at 100%.
 - maxim,fan-rd-signal: Boolean; Fans provide a rotation detection (RD) signal
   instead of generating square-wave pulses.
 - maxim,fan-rd-polarity-high: Boolean; If true, RD is high when the fan is
   running; otherwise, it is low. Only relevant when fan-rd-signal is true.
 - maxim,fan-signal-enabled: Boolean; Externally driving FF/FS low forces PWM
   output to 100%.
 - maxim,fan-spin-up-enabled: Boolean; On fan startup set the PWM to 100% until
   tach is detected or two seconds have passed before reducing to the target
   value.
 - maxim,pwm-polarity-negative: Boolean; If trye, 100% PWM is when PWM is low,
   not high.
 - maxim,pwm-pulse-stretch-enabled: Boolean; Enable PWM pulse stretching.
 - maxim,pwm-zero-fan-can-fail: Boolean; Enable fan failure detection while
   ramping to 0% PWM.

Fan sub-nodes must be present in order to enable the fan.

Required fan sub-node properties:
 - reg: Fan address. Must be <0x00> or <0x01>.

Optional fan sub-node properties:
 - label: String; Assigned to the hwmon fanX_label property.

Temperature sub-nodes are optional.

Required temp sub-node properties:
 - reg: Temperature sensor address. Must be <0x00> or <0x01>.

Optional temp sub-node properties:
 - label: String; Assigned to the hwmon tempX_label property.
 - ideality: For temperature node with reg 1 only: Set ideality factor for the
   remote temperature sensor. Integer with range 0 to 63, representing a
   multiplication factor of 0.9844 to 1.0489. Default: 24 (1.0080).

Example:
	max31760@50 {
		compatible = "maxim,max31760";
		reg = <0x50>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		maxim,fan-spin-up-enabled;

		fan@0 {
			reg = <0x00>;
			label = "Left";
		};
		fan@1 {
			reg = <0x01>;
			label = "Right";
		};
		temp@1 {
			reg = <0x01>;
			label = "CPU";
		};
	};
